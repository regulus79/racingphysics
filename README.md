# racingphysics

An unfinished mod adding a racecar which approximates rigidbody physics using verlet integration.

## Usage

Use /test2 to spawn a car.

## Background

I made this mod a very long time ago, and I have not looked at the code in months.

It is unlikely that I will continue working on this project; there were some major bugs with the physics which I am unsure of the root cause (car rolling around on the ground forever; car gets yeeted when colliding with nodes.)
