# racingphysics

An unfinished mod using verlet integration to create a rigidbody racecar.

## Usage

Use /test2 to spawn a car.

Use /pf to toggle press-forward mode

## Background

I made this mod a very long time ago, and I have not looked at the code in months.

It is unlikely that I will finish this project; I have lost most of my enthusiasm for working on it.

Additionally, there were some major bugs with the physics which I am unsure of the root cause (car rolling around on the ground forever; car gets yeeted when colliding with nodes.) If I found out the cause of these bugs, then perhaps that would prove that the physics is still salavagable. For now, I would rather start fresh with a completely new physics engine rather than trying to debug this one.
